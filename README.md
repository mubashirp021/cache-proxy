# Caching Proxy Server (CLI Tool)

A simple command-line proxy server in Java.  
It forwards HTTP requests to real servers and caches responses.  
Repeated requests are served directly from the cache.

# First request â†’ Cache MISS (fetched from server)
# Second request â†’ Cache HIT (served from cache)
